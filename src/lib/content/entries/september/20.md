"Arrived at Murmansk at 11.30 anchoring some distance above Alexandrovsk. There is one very amusing incident, which I had almost forgotten to relate. Frequently (whilst lying off Archangel) boats would come alongside with various articles of produce, which the natives brought to exchange for flour, tea, sugar, butter etc. They would bring cabbage, milk, eggs, and live chickens. Two of the men skulkered some flour and other articles for some fowls. They reckoned on getting some eggs. A nice little run was made for the fowls and the two men in question got orders for new laid eggs. Early the next morning they were awakened by a lot of crowing. The two marines were disappointed to find that their hens were cockerels. Of course all the ships company had the news by this time and the two men were mercilessly chaffed about the eggs that were ordered. The poor birds did not live many minutes after this.
