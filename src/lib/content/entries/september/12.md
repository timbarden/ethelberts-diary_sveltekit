## 14th-18th September

"All these days have had the usual plethora of rumours. A good number of Bolo prisoners have passed through under charge of Russian guards. Fighting is more general along all the fronts close to Archangel. The Bolos entered Bereznik on Tuesday but were driven out by a party of Blue jackets landed from one of the monitors. We have only two hospital boats up the river now and they are expected down tomorrow. Most of the big transports will be leaving during the next week. I am to be drafted to the SS Aro and from there perhaps to the Baltic. Very white sharp frosts occur most nights now and it is difficult to keep warm in bed even with four blankets. These are very busy days, such large quantities of stores to be packed. We are finally giving up the barge on Monday next the 22nd.
