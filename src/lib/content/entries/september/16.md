## 22nd September

"We are saying "dasfidania" to NT 332, everything possible has been packed but still lots of things are being left behind or dumped. Wouldn't the ratepayers' hearts ache if they did but know what is thrown away? What a revelation? We leave NT 332 with some feelings of regret. All the ships company has been distributed to various homeward bound boats. Some to the Czar, some to the Garth Castle, others to Queen Empress and two of us to the Aro (Seaton and myself). This is a special favour granted to us by the commander as a mark of approval. We got on board at 5pm. We travel as saloon passengers, have stewards to wait on us, and a very nice cabin to ourselves. Our boat leaves for Murmansk on Thursday. The last leave ashore is on Wednesday 24th.
