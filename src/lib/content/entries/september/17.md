"I went ashore today for a final visit to Archangel. Although there is an element of danger surrounding us yet after all we are somewhat sorry to leave Archangel for we feel that the place will be occupied by the Bolshevicks and many excesses committed. The people generally too are sorry for they fear the future. It has been a profitable time for them, our fellows have spent the greater part of their money in various ways and the city is richer for our visit. Yet it is to be feared that much distress will follow after our departure. The Russian troops are most unreliable. It remains to be seen whether the citizen army has any more stamina.

"The weather is getting very cold and the first appearance of ice has been seen by some of us who get up early enough. We don't mind the cold so much on the Aro because our cabins are nicely warmed with steam pipes. We are very fortunate in getting a passage on so big and comfortable a ship. All the people aboard are kind and most anxious for our comfort giving us a hearty welcome with one exception and that is the chief sick berth steward a fellow named Fugelir a most detestable cad who objects to us because he is an active service rating and we are MMRs. As anyone can guess he is altogether a contemptible thing apart from the fact of his incompetents. We do not desire his company being saloon passengers and quite happy.
