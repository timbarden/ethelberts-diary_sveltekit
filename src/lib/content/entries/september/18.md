"Two of the river transports have been taken to the White Sea today and blown up. It was considered that the expense of taking them home would be greater than their value apart from the fact of their unseaworthiness. It can scarcely be said that these paddle steamers have justified the expenditure. Apart from the upkeep I understand that the fitting out of the nine hospital carriers amounted to Â£2,000,000. Some of them did practically nothing. None have done a great deal. It has been a mismanaged affair altogether.
