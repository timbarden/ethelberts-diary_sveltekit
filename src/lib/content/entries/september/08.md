## 10th September

[entered in the diary as August] "Another stormy day. Discharged a great quantity of foodstuffs. A big ship coming alongside almost smashed our barge. The sides were stove in also our lifeboat had one side stove in. Thousands of logs have broken loose and are floating up river on a strong tide and a heavy wind. Not only is it a loss of a big fortune but they create a serious danger to small boats, steam pinnaces etc. Everything seems to be going adrift in Archangel and indeed all over Russia. The people are greatly upset because the British are clearing out. As soon as we evacuate the Bolos will come in. Then will commence a terrible time for the people. I'm afraid massacres will be a daily occurrence, and also German influence is sure to operate strongly against right and order. There are dark days ahead for Russia. The winter is setting in now. Tonight is very cold and wet.
