"HMS Cyclops came in today and various other craft from Archangel completing the evacuation. Early this morning there was a magnificent display of Northern lights. It was beautiful in the extreme. After taking 32 officers aboard we sailed at 5.45 for England. In consequence of this unexpected arrival of officers and the shortage of staff I offered my services as a wardroom steward, which were very welcome.
