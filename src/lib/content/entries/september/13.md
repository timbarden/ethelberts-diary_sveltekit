## 19th September

"Very many troops have come down the line leaving things in the hands of the Russians. I hope they will show more pluck than they have done previously. A large number of civilians are drilling every evening for the defence of Archangel. Several transports loaded with Russian troops left Saborne quay this afternoon for Bereznik. Great crowds gathered to bid them farewell. They left with parting cheers, the music from a band and much waving of handkerchiefs etc. The soldiers themselves singing the usual Russian songs which consist of about 6 notes. This evening there was a beautiful display of Northern lights. The best I've seen so far. They were like immense waving curtains scintillating with exquisite colours changing very rapidly. The display lasted about an hour. (Those who read these notes must excuse the scribble because of the difficulties under which they are done).
