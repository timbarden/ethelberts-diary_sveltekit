## 4th September

"Resumed our journey at 4.30 for Archangel reaching Ust Pinega at 1.30. The weather is glorious and after a tremendous storm the sun shines out in full splendour again. The river is very pretty or at least the banks are on either side. We have now about 70 miles to go before reaching Archangel. Most of the fellows are anxious to get there and secure a place on one of the first boats going home. We are travelling at the rate of 5 to 6 miles an hour. The Lord Morten met us just before we reached the bar. We were quite excited when she signalled that there were mails aboard for us. When the mails came there were 5 letters, 2 parcels and newspapers for me. Proceeding we reached Archangel at 5pm and went alongside the Garth Castle transferring all our English patients to her. We lay alongside till this morning.
