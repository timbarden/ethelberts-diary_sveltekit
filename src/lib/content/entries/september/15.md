## 21st September

"Sunday but it was scarcely like a Sabbath day. This being our last full day on 332 everything has to be washed up. All the officers' things cleaned. Surplus gear was packed etc. The Courier came alongside during the evening. The Bolos raked her with shrapnel just before they reached Bereznik. Four of the sick berth staff were wounded. A barge loaded with troops was also fired up with machine guns. Eight were killed and a few wounded. Two of our monitors which could not be removed (as they drew too much water) were blown up after being dismantled. The NT 245 has been towed a few miles up the river to bring in the few remaining soldiers. Some trouble is expected in Archangel. Barbed wire defenses are being erected across the entrances to the landing stages and sentries posted at a number of places.
