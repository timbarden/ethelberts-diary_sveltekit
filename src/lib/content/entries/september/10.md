## 12th September

"Another very stormy day. A most interesting sight was to see the hundreds of refugees with their personal belongings coming into the compounds. One long string of droskys loaded with all sorts of refugee's property lined the quayside. There must have been at least 150, and then to see the refugees themselves passing up the gangway into the great Vedic. A long, long trail indeed as though there were no end. It took nearly all day for the procession to pass into the ship. Besides this lot there were about 300 Russian soldiers. They all have an idea that they are going to stay in England but they are doomed to disappointment. Had two letters today. We understand that the last mail is leaving for England tomorrow.
