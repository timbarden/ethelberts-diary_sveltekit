## 7th September

[entered in the diary as August] "Fifteen of our company were sent to the SS King Edward before leaving for home. Three barge loads of Russian troops arrived from Ust Pinega and lay alongside and also a barge with field guns and about 100 tons of ammunition. After being so close to the one that blew up and having so close a shave we have no great love for ammunition barges. This evening it has all been unloaded onto the quay but we are still alongside of it.
