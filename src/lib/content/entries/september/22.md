## 28th September

"The admirals' yacht has gone ashore some little distance astern of our boat. Several tugs are endeavouring to get her off, so far without success. Weather very stormy and cold. A great number of vessels have come in during the last 24 hours. Archangel must be quite evacuated by this time. We are having a good time on this packet. Nice, warm, cosy cabin, good food and plenty of it. Our companions too are sociable and jolly. We have varied our routine today by rifle practice using bottles as targets. I sank two first shot in each instance. Not so bad. We hope to have big gun practice when we get outside again. Lewis gun practice as well.
