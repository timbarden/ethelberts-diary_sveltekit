## 24th July

"July 24th. My surgeon has been temporarily transferred to SS Courier. I'm to go with him. We are to go to Troitsa, the most advanced fighting line, 40 miles further up the river, for sick and wounded. Started at 2.30. There are many channels up this section of the river but now that the water is so low there is only one navigable. In some parts the river must be 3 to 4 miles wide. Great sandbanks 10 to 20 feet thick and from â€“ to 1 mile in width stretch across the river. When the flood time comes all these banks are covered and the largest vessels can come up. There must be 40 to 50 feet of water when the river is in flood. It is a fine sight in early spring. Distant villages and the inevitable pair of churches are very frequent. The churches are always in pairs, generally one steeple green and gold and the other brown. We passed the wreck of a Bolo gunboat, which was sunk by shellfire from one of our monitors. Lying on the sands on our right some distance further on are the remains of a British hydroplane just like a bird with broken wings. Its occupants escaped without injury. This part of the river is not so beautiful or interesting as the Pinega River. On either side miles and miles of sand, in the far distance there are some big forests.

"We pass two paddle steamers, their superstructures just above water. They are the Sword Dance and Fandango both used as mine sweepers and gunboats. Both struck mines and sunk. The water here is much deeper. We also passed the remains of an aeroplane smashed up through engine trouble. Troitsa was reached at 11 o'clock.
