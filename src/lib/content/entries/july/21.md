## 22nd July

"July 22nd. A big fire has occurred at the aerodrome, most of the machines have been saved. There is also a large forest fire raging some little distance away. A good many vessels have been stuck in the sandbanks in their endeavours to reach Bereznik. It looks awkward for us too. No mails. Up to date I've only had two from home and three from friends.
