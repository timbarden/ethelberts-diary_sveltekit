## 27th July

"July 27th. Various rumours about evacuation also of a final stint of our troops at Troitsa before turning things over to Russian troops. We hear of the probability of a Bolo attack on Bereznik. General Ironside with his staff transferred to Archangel, General Jackson's brigade taking their place. Had a delightful stroll through the meadows, woods and villages close by. The peculiar methods of Russian agriculture are very interesting. Potatoes are not planted in straight rows but all over the ground, each plant being earthed up by itself. Wild flowers are very beautiful. Forget-me-nots, Marguerites, Cornflowers etc reminding one of the country at home. In the village there was quite an amusing scene. The YMCA manager was trying to teach a crowd of boys how to play football. The youngsters had no boots on and they were playing on a rough road covered with wood chippings, but they got on very well.
