## 18th July

"July 18th. The weather continues very hot although there is a little breeze, which makes it somewhat more bearable. Still lying at Ust Pinega. The natives take full advantage of our fellows camping here. I tried to buy some 'yates' (eggs) they asked 4 Russian roubles (1/-) each. Some excitement was caused today, by an aeroplane circling around the camp and dropping a message, we understand it was an urgent one from Pinega.

"The nights are gradually getting darker. The sun set at 10 o'clock tonight and it was a magnificent spectacle. We sleep on the deck in preference to the cabin, which is too stuffy. Although there was a heavy thunderstorm one night yet I slept on the deck with a couple of oilskins over me.
