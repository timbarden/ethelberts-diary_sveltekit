## 19th July

"July 19th. Gathered a fine lot of bilberries this afternoon. Left Ust Pinega for Bereznik at 4pm. It seemed likely that we should have some trouble with our Captain who had made up his mind that he was going to Pinega (where his home is) and he did not like going to Bereznik which is right up in the fighting line. Eventually he cooled down and we proceeded on our course. I lost our stiff broom overboard today which is a sad loss for brooms are scarce and difficult to get. We are passing some magnificent country. On the shore the people are very busy haymaking and harvesting. The girls in their varied bright colours, the beautiful forests and glorious sunshine make a brilliant panorama. It is a pleasurable trip altogether, a nice cool breeze is blowing, tempering the heat and making the day most enjoyable. Our little paddleboat is chug, chugging along as though she too was having a good time off it. We pass a number of villages with names too quaint to spell or pronounce properly but they are something like the following, Sto-pe-nor, Co-pe-washo-wo, Cre-voy-a, and many others.
