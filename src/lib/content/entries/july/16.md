## 17th July

"July 17th. There was great excitement today upon the arrival of a NACB barge. This will enable us to buy a few more luxuries making a change from macaroni or bully beef. Large supplies of stores, guns, ammunition, troops etc landed here today making a great addition to the camp. Had a beautiful and delightful walk along the cliffs bringing back with me a nice lot of blueberries. Several officers came in for dinner today. Our cooking was quite successful. We gave them a five course dinner. The bilberries were enjoyed by them all. We also cooked a berry like a blackberry in shape but in colour yellow and pink. Did not care for them a great deal there were too many seeds.

"The funeral took place today of a RE soldier who was killed several days ago. The men have a habit when taking their horses for a wash in the river of hanging on to their tails. This is all right if the horse is swimming but a dangerous game if standing in the water. It was so in this case. The man was bathing and hanging on to the horse's tail when it kicked out striking him in the forehead stunning him. He sank and was carried out by the strong current. His body came ashore three days later. It was intended to bury him in the churchyard and a grave was dug but at the last moment the priest objected. So he was taken to a little cemetery outside the village and buried there with full military honours.
