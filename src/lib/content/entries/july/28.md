"Reached Ust Pinega at 7pm next morning. We had a good number of sick off the barge here leaving for Archangel at 9am. (It has been a very, very cold night. I had been on watch through the night. Took on wood at 4am). Our little boat is quite full this trip and I find it hard work to feed them all. No provision is made for cooking and I shall be glad to reach Archangel, which will probably be 5 o'clock.

"Arrived at 6, and disembarked the officers at Somalic quay, then proceeded to the Garth Castle with two sick naval ratings, afterwards to Solombola with remaining patients returning to Somalic quay at 11 o'clock.
