## 25th July

"July 25th. Early this morning we took aboard a number from the hospital barge 335. Also several cot cases from HMS Hyderabad. It will be a long time before there is enough water to float this gunboat down, although there is plenty of water here there are too many shallows between here and Archangel. Probably it will be the end of August before she comes down. The return trip to Bereznik was commenced at 8.30am. We stopped at Tulgas to take on patients from the hospital barge there and also to bunker. Went ashore here and gathered a nice lot of 'makinas' (raspberries). A short distance inland the country is apparently very fertile. Left Tulgas at 10.15, reaching Bereznik at 3.30. Disembarked our patients on to barge 332, the surgeon and myself rejoining the SS Smaillie.
