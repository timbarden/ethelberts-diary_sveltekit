## 28th July

"July 28th. Received orders to go down stream about 80 miles to a stranded hospital barge and evacuate her patients and staff to Archangel. Left at 7.30. Reached the barge at 6pm and left at 6.30pm passing HMS Glow-worm at 7pm. Our skipper not understanding did not stop when ordered by the Glow-worm's commander who sent a steam pinnace after us and threatened to sink us. We returned. Humble apologies were made to Captain Green who cursed us very heartily in real British fashion. Took a patient (Russian officer) off this boat.
