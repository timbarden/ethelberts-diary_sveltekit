## 21st July

"July 21st.[^1]

"Arrived at Bereznik at one am. It thus took us 30 hours to do the distance of 120[^2] miles. This is a busy military and naval centre, numerous craft of all sorts, shapes and sizes are lying on the river. Close to us is the Queen Empress, a paddle steamer rather larger than the London Belle. She is a Clyde boat fitted out as a hospital ship. She draws too much water to go further up for the river continues to fall rapidly, neither can she return because of the sandbanks. She will have to remain till the rainy season at the end of August. The large hospital barges are well equipped and very creditable. Aeroplanes and hydroplanes are busy, especially at night when they go off on their bombing expeditions.

"News has come to us of a mutiny amongst some Russian troops. They have murdered their officers (13), English and Russian. We hear that most of the mutineers have been killed or captured. Those captured have been brought down to Bereznik.

"July 21st. The trial took place today of the mutineers, most of them will be shot tonight.

"6.30. Five[^3] of the condemned men have been executed on the bank close to us. The weather continues hot during the day but the nights are cold.
