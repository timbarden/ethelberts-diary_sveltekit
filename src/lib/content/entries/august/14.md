"An aeroplane came over this morning very much damaged. One of its occupants was hanging over the side either killed or badly hurt. Several of our fellows were up before the commander this afternoon for firing rifles on the right bank of the river during the previous night causing some uneasiness and consternation among the inhabitants of a little village close handy. There was a deal of excitement also on the HC4. Two of their number had gone into this village and were arrested. They did not regain their liberty till a SBL officer appeared. In their rage they went over to the other side and obtained some Mills' bombs. It was their intention to return to the village and bomb the people. On the return journey they called at the HC4 to try and get some of the other fellows to go with them. Fortunately the captain got wind of this little expedition and he promptly stopped it. If their intention had been carried out things would have been very awkward for lots of the people are not too friendly as it is. NT barge Michigan cleared of patients preparatory to going down river. We evacuated 23 of our sick on to the Voligshannon.
