## 4th August

"There was a very violent storm today. Our little sick bay and sleeping quarters were flooded. After the rain I spent a busy four hours nailing tin on the roof to cover the holes burnt by the sparks from the funnel. Cap covers, coats, shirts etc have suffered a similar fate from the red-hot cinders (of course we could not nail tin on them). Another flying machine accident occurred today. One machine crashed down into another that was just getting ready to fly. After smashing this it continued its work of destruction by finishing off another machine that fell a few days previously it then smashed itself to pieces.

"The sunset tonight was very exquisite. For a night and a day I've had a very bad attack of ptomaine poisoning. Many cases have come under my care for treatment suffering from this complaint but this is my first personal acquaintance with it. My sympathies go out to any one who has an attack. No pain accompanies it but the itching is simply awful. Rest is out of the question completely.
