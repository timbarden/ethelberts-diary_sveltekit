## 2nd August

"Reached the Glow-worm at 4.30am and put one rating aboard whom we picked up at Ust Pinega. Proceeded to X 170, which has been stranded for about 3 weeks. Got alongside at 5.30 am delivered some letters etc resuming our journey at 6am. We have about 75 miles in front of us before reaching Bereznik. There was heavy rain again today.
