## 9th August

"After a very wet uncomfortable night we reached Troitsa at 8am on August 9th and berthed along SS Courier. The Officers [?] and I were transferred to this boat and my mate remained on the Smaillie to look after the stores. Heavy rains. There is some prospect now of the bigger ships getting down. I believe we are evacuating Troitsa after a big stint either today or tomorrow.
