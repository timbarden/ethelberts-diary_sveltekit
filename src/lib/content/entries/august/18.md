"The HC4 is being lightened as much as possible. All the iron bedsteads have been taken down and fitted on our barge. As much of her superstructure and surplus stores etc have also been taken off. She draws 18ins less water. The river has also risen. Today a fresh job has been given to me. I'm put in charge of the wardroom and also have 4 officers to look after. The evacuation of Bereznik is proceeding rapidly.
