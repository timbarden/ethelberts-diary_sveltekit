"More wounded brought aboard today several of them being Bolos (2 officers) very badly hurt. Talking with several of our fellows who were right in the firing line I learnt that the fighting was much more severe than was expected and the prisoners more numerous (several thousands). The wounded Bolos seemed very glad to be on our barge. They appear to be half starved and ragged and dirty. They are agreeably surprised at the kindly treatment given them. It was a treat too to have a comfortable bed to lie upon. The river is rising steadily in consequence of the heavy rains. Bolos have been driven back a considerable distance, about 50 miles.
