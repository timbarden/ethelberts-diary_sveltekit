## 11th August

"Excellent progress has been made by the troops. Several villages captured. Many prisoners are coming along the riverbanks, about 2000 reported up to 11am. Our casualties are numerous but nothing in comparison to the Bolo's. The British have been using gas shells and numbers of the enemy have come in blinded (temporarily). Prisoners are still coming in, amongst them some women wearing bandoliers and carrying rifles. A continuous line of droskies with wounded are coming along the banks. Two Bolo monitors have been captured by scooters and one sunk by gunfire. One of our minesweepers was sunk through striking a mine this afternoon. The British officer and crew were drowned. The rain today has been exceptionally heavy. We loaded up with wounded at 6pm. Many of them badly knocked about. Our troops have lost a lot killed. One company was cut up entirely, very few escaping. More prisoners are arriving. Among the wounded on board our packet is a little boy and a girl of about 16. Both hit by shrapnel in feet and legs. They are from Seltzo. Our boat reached Bereznik at 11pm, transferring the load of patients to NT 332, the Michigan and HC4. I was now sent for duty on 332.
