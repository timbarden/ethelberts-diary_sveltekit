"There have been some most exquisite rainbow scenes for 9 days in succession, very beautiful to see stretching from bank to bank of the wide river making a perfect archway and today the beauty was increased as one of our airman came flying down from Troitsa and passed beneath the centre of the gigantic arch. The rainbows were always in pairs.
