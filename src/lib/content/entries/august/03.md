## 3rd August

"Berthed alongside HC4 at 2am on August 3rd. When at Bereznik the previous week we were entertained every afternoon watching the performances of a Russian flying officer. He did some marvellous flying, looping the loop etc. During the war with Germany this officer had 50 German machines to his credit. We deeply regret to receive the news today that he has just been killed. His machine got out of control and crashed to the ground.

"During the evening I saw a most beautiful sight, the reflection of a very brilliant rainbow arching the river from bank to bank. It was reflected in the water making a complete circle. Those who appreciate beauty and colour had a rare treat.
