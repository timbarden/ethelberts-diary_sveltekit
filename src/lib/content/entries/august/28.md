## 29th August

"On the 29th we reached the bar (about 75 miles down river) at 2pm. During the morning the Hyderabad, Cockchafer, Glow-worm and Humber passed us. At one o'clock we sighted the poor Queen Empress piled up on the mud. Understand that there is not much hope for her as the water is falling again and the tugs cannot move her.
