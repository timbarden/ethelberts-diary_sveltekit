## 13th June

"On the 13th of June at 4.30am we left for Aberdeen. It was a good trip and without incident except that about half-way across the engine bearings became overheated, making it necessary to lie-to for them to cool. This delayed us about two hours.

"Reaching Aberdeen at 6pm the same day we tied up alongside the quay to go through the usual experience of cooling and watering. Being allowed ashore we paid an evening visit to this interesting city. Aberdeen is a very fine town. Its fish quays are marvellously clean and well arranged. The streets too are kept in splendid order. Its system of tramways is one of the best I've seen. Union Street is a street of which any city might well be proud. Fine commercial buildings of granite give a most imposing and substantial appearance to this wide thoroughfare, speaking of prosperity and progress. We all hope to visit Aberdeen again.

"I went for a long tram ride to the Dee valley and was well repaid. One thing amused me both in Newcastle and Aberdeen in connection with the trams:- viz. The corporations issue Â½d tram fares, both for soldiers and sailors. It is very considerate of them. We appreciate greatly these acts of consideration. Speaking generally, wherever we went, the people were always kindly disposed towards us; there was scarcely an exception.
