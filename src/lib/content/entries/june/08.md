## 20th June

"At 7am on June 20th the next stage in our journey was commenced. From now onwards the country near the sea became more fertile. Trees covered the lower slopes of the hills. Villages and fishing centres became more frequent. Little patches of cultivated ground were noticeable and the pretty white churches dotted here and there made the whole scene from Christiansund to Bodo very beautiful. I think we enjoyed our short stay at this place more than at any other thus far. One or two of the people could speak fluent English. Two gentlemen took me to their home and entertained me to tea. One peculiar item of diet was the sweet cheese, which was very appetizing. Perhaps this was because I had been living on ships biscuits and bully beef so long. As usual crowds of folk lined the quay to greet us and send us off with good wishes.
