## 19th June

"The boat left Aalsund at 8am on the 19th. All the way the trip through these Norwegian fjords and between the numerous islands was a real delightful treat and I for one stayed on deck as much as possible. We had very little sleep because it never got dusk and sleep seemed out of the question when amongst such beautiful scenery and with such glorious sunshine. At the foot of the high rocks and hills we noticed numerous patches of bright green grass and funny little houses painted in vivid colours - red, green, yellow and some white making a most picturesque scene.

"Arriving at Christiansund the same day at 1.30 we anchored some distance from the shore. The people here did not seem quite as hospitable as those at Aalsund, but perhaps it was mere imagination. It is a much larger city and quite a charming place with its varied colours, architecture and peculiar positions of the buildings. As usual we took on board coal and water. No one was sorry to leave Christiansund.
