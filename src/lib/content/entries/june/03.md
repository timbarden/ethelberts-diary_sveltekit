12th June

"Early on the morning of the 12th some little excitement was caused by hearing loud cries of "ship ahoy". We could not see who was calling for some time but at last we discovered a man in the water astern of us holding onto a 'scope with one hand and a bicycle with the other. He had been riding along the quay wall when he was tripped up by a stone and thus had an early morning dive. He was rescued by one of our seamen, named Pat, a typical Irishman.
