## 17th June

"We left Lerwick on the 17th at 5am for Norway. The North Sea was wonderfully kind to us and except for a heavy ground swell there was nothing to complain about. Crossing the North Sea there is some danger of striking floating mines. Our old pack had a narrow escape from two. One passed within a few yards of her port paddle box.

"We reached the coast of Norway about noon, arriving at Aalsund, our first port of call, in the evening at 8pm. We were allowed ashore. Everyone was very kind to us. Crowds of people lined the quay to watch our arrival. Aalsund is a charming little town of some 3,000 inhabitants. At one of the cafés the proprietress kindly made our party some excellent coffee with plenty of milk and sugar, also beef and cheese sandwiches, all of which was very enjoyable. This was about 9 o'clock in the evening. Business did not really begin till after 12 when the theatres opened and people turned out to enjoy themselves. The view from a little café perched high on a rock was magnificent.
