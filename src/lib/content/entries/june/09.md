## 22nd June

"On the 22nd at 3.30pm we left Bodo for Tromso arriving at 8pm the same day. It was an enjoyable trip although it was a bit choppy when we got to the open sea. This was only for a few hours for we were soon amongst the islands again and into calm water. Tromso is in the Vest Fjord. We were not allowed ashore at this port but as one looked at it, some little distance off, the town had a clean and prosperous appearance. Our stay here was only for a few hours, just to take on coal and water. While lying there the tug Flying Foam from Murmansk came alongside and reported passing through a severe storm, also that she had sighted our sister ship the Walton Belle which had preceded us by some 12 hours. She had to take shelter in the nearest port. The Flying Foam carried our mails to England.
