## 27th-28th June

"I had a very enjoyable walk across the island, which is pretty in some parts. There are peat bogs covering a considerable portion. The peat is dug, dried and used for fuel. A good deal of snow was still lying in the hollows. The night of the 27th and 28th was beautiful and the midnight sun shone with exceptional brilliance, not a cloud in the sky. Leaving Vardo at 1.10am we proceeded towards the Murmansk coast reaching the depot ships HMS Glory T at 5pm on the 28th and we anchored off the town of Alexandrovsk. After the stormy passage from Hammerfest to Vardo, the voyage through the still island waters was very agreeable. It is a beautiful 'night' of sunshine again, sleep seems out of the question. The weather is very hot and we are constantly tormented by swarms of mosquitoes. The welcome message has just come through that peace was signed at 3 o'clock today. This was duly celebrated in the usual naval fashion by the blowing of the sirens of all the ships in harbour. Our little steamer seemed to make the biggest noise of all the lot. After this there came the splicing of the main brace and all who wished had a double tot of rum.
