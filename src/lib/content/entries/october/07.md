## 7th October

"Ship got under way at 7am. Sea beautifully calm. Making splendid headway. Boat doing 11 knots. During the afternoon we had a sight, which is rarely seen in these days. We passed at very close quarters a full rigged ship with all her canvas spread. It is years ago since I saw so beautiful a sight. She was a vessel as big as ours with her white canvas filling with the breeze she looked very majestic. At 8pm we are making splendid progress off the Scotch coast.
