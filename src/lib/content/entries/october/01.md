## 1st October

"Another stormy day. Many of us feel very seasick. Fortunately I've been able to keep going but lots of the officers who came aboard at Murmansk had to keep to their bunks. North Cape was sighted at 6.30 and here we got the roughest sea and heavy snowstorms. We could see that North Cape and surrounding hills and mountains were covered thick with snow.
