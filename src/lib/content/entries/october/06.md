## 6th October

"Sea rough, strong headwind. In consequence of having the 32 extra officers on board fresh provisions are running short so we shall be obliged to put into Lerwick. Ship is pitching a great deal.

"Reached Lerwick at one pm. The officers went ashore at 5 o'clock. I went at 6.15. Lerwick is a nice clean little town. Most of the inhabitants apparently are well to do. My mate and I strolled around the town after which we went to the little picture house. The film on the screen was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Halifax,_Gentleman_(1915_film)" target="_blank">*John Halifax, Gentleman*</a>. It was quite good. Coming from there to the duty boat we looked into the recreation room in connection with the 'Mission to seamen' and I was surprised to see an old Newportonian, Mr Greenshields. Also at the bar was an SBR who was at Hasler at the same time as myself.

"The duty boat left the quay at 10.30. Nearly all the officers were drunk. Certainly everyone had too much to drink. My mate and I out of about 40 who went ashore were the only two quite sober.
