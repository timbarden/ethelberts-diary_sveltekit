"Proceeded further up the Thames and then had to return to Tilbury. There was a lot of grumbling amongst the officers also amongst the ships crew at the delay. They are all so anxious to get to their homes.

"Arrived off Tilbury at 3.30 and anchored. At last a tug came alongside for the officers and there ensued a scene of wild confusion. Such a tremendous lot of luggage for the 32 officers. We were heartily glad to see the back of them. My opinion of British military officers was never very high; it is considerably, very, very considerably lower now. Uncouth, untidy, lazy without even the first principles of gentlemanly behaviour etc. and their language and conversation disgusting.
