## 13th-14th October

"Quiet days. Lying out in the Thames there is not much happening. The King's yacht passed close to us with his Majesty aboard. During the past night I was awakened by a bang close to my cabin. Looking out I saw that a big ship had dragged her anchor and swung round on us. It caused some excitement. Fortunately very little damage was done. We seem rather in the way here.
