## 2nd October

"SS Lord Morten reached us at 6.30 this morning and most of our patients were transferred to her. I had a very enjoyable afternoon ashore, exploring the country around. The people are still hay making. Left Siscoe at 12 noon. Anchored for the night at 9.15. There was a most remarkable phenomenon visible tonight. The moon showed up like a great conflagration, it seemed to lessen somewhat and at last resolved itself into an immense red ball.
