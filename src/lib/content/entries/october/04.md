## 4th October

"Weather altered for worse during the night. Sea very rough and the boat is pitching a great deal. At times her stern is 30ft out of the water and then as the propeller races the whole ship seems as though she would break in pieces. Sighted the SS Cap Verde about 5 miles distant, apparently having as rough a time of it as we. Wind moderating a little and the swell not quite so bad.
