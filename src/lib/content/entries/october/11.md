## 12th October

"During the night we were nearly rammed by a barge. It just missed our bows and ran across our anchor cables. She stuck there till this morning and was then towed off by a tug. It seems strange to hear the church bells in the distance. Although this is a Sunday yet it does not seem like it and I shall be very, very glad to be ashore again and enjoy a real English Sabbath day. For several months now I've not been to a place of worship and it is a sad loss.
